# Sound2Color
Converts incoming sound data from the phone's microphone into the corresponding bass, mid and treble ranges, allowing the user to see its decomposition. Supported by Android Studio. Nearly all credit is attributed to Yavor Ivanov of New Venture Software, who provided me with his code as an essential starting point for this project.
